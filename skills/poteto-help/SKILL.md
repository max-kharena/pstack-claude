description: Guides users through pstack setup, /poteto-mode, and picking the skill, playbook, or principle for a task. Use for /poteto-help, or when the user asks how to install, set up, or use pstack, or which pstack skill fits. Not for requests to do work, even ones that name pstack.

# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

A message that asks for work, such as "use pstack to fix this bug", is not a help question. Read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md), do the work under it, and mention once that the `poteto` output style keeps it on.

This file maps questions to the skills and guide pages that hold the answers. Those files own the details. Read the file you route to before you quote it, and trust it when it disagrees with this map. The links here point into the installed plugin, which the user may not be able to open, so give the user the file's public copy: `https://github.com/max-kharena/pstack-claude/blob/main/` followed by its path. pstack skills are slash-only, so read a routed skill as the file `../<name>/SKILL.md` next to this one, and name it to the user as `/pstack:<name>`.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- No `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` means `/pstack:setup-pstack` hasn't run for this user, so every role uses its default model.
- No `verify-*` skill or other app harness in the project means agents have no scripted way to drive the app. Mention `/create-verification-skill` when the question is about proving a change works.

## Get set up

1. Install with `/plugin marketplace add max-kharena/pstack-claude`, then `/plugin install pstack@pstack-claude`. A team enables it for a repo through `.claude/settings.json` (the [README](../../README.md) has the snippet).
2. Run [`/pstack:setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md). It asks for a budget, maps a model to each role, and writes a user rule. The rule applies to new sessions.
3. Start a real task with `/poteto-mode`, a goal, and a check that can pass or fail.

Installing changes nothing until the user invokes a skill. Only `/pstack:setup-pstack` and `/pstack:poteto-help` load from the user's words. Every pstack skill also answers to its bare name, such as `/poteto-mode`, when no other plugin uses that name. The [README](../../README.md) and [guide page 1](../../docs/guide/01-setup.md) have the details. Offer to word their first prompt with them.

If cost is the worry, say where the tokens go and how to spend fewer. pstack spends extra tokens on subagents and review panels. Rerun `/pstack:setup-pstack` and pick a smaller budget or cheaper models. A role set to `inherit` runs on the session's model, which saves tokens when the session runs on a cheaper model. A shorter panel list runs fewer subagents, one for each entry. Save `/poteto-mode` for work that needs rigor.

This is the Claude Code port of pstack, which upstream is built for Cursor. Its workflow skills, including `/poteto-mode`, `/how`, `/why`, and `/teach`, spawn Claude Code subagents with a model per role. Every Agent seat is a Claude model, so the review panels mix Opus, Sonnet, and Fable instead of upstream's Claude, GPT, and Grok. `/pstack:setup-pstack` can add a non-Claude seat through an external CLI such as `codex`.

## Start a task with `/poteto-mode`

`/poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the todo list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. [Guide page 2](../../docs/guide/02-poteto-mode.md) has examples.

Whether `/poteto-mode` stays on depends on how the user starts it:

- `/pstack:poteto-mode <task>` attaches the skill to that task. It fades as the session moves on.
- `/output-style poteto` (or `"outputStyle": "poteto"` in settings) keeps it on every turn. It applies itself when a playbook matches or a task needs rigor, and stays out of casual turns. `/output-style default` turns it off.
- `claude --agent pstack:poteto-agent` runs the whole session as the poteto agent.

Link [Claude Code's output style docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles) when this comes up. Mid-chat, "new task" makes the mode match a fresh playbook. `/poteto-mode` already uses `pstack:poteto-agent` for the subagents its playbook steps spawn. To get the same style from a subagent of your own, spawn it with `subagent_type: "pstack:poteto-agent"`.

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/how` explains what the code does. `/why` explains the reasons. `/teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/interrogate` reviews the diff. `/blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

Not in pstack:

- `/loop` is a Claude Code built-in. `skill-creator` ships in Anthropic's skills plugin.
- `/deslop`, `control-cli`, and `control-ui` come from Cursor's team kit upstream. This port bundles them.
- pstack has no `/orchestrate` skill. Orchestrate is a `/poteto-mode` playbook. If the slash menu shows `/orchestrate`, another plugin provides it.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs Autopilot-full. "stack them, don't ship" runs Autopilot-stack.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

Without `/poteto-mode`, a phrase such as "babysit this pr" can start another installed skill for the same job instead. The Playbooks section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists every playbook and when it applies. [Guide page 6](../../docs/guide/06-verify-and-ship.md) covers opening, babysitting, and landing a PR.

pstack has no planning skill. Claude Code's plan mode works alongside it. For work that spans phases or stacked PRs, asking `/poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and doesn't implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output." Typing `/principle-<name>` still loads one on demand. [Guide page 8](../../docs/guide/08-principles.md) lists them.

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The mode stopped applying after a few turns | It was started for one task. Switch on `/output-style poteto`, or start each task with `/poteto-mode`. |
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | The rule from `/setup-pstack` loads at session start. Start a new session. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill didn't load on its own | Only `/setup-pstack` and `/poteto-help` load from the user's words. The others load when the user types them or when `/poteto-mode` runs them, and it doesn't run every skill. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Spawn each with `isolation: "worktree"`, or `isolation: "remote"` where available, which gives each its own machine. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | `/loop` needs a check that can pass or fail, not a duration. See [guide page 7](../../docs/guide/07-overnight.md). |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

[Guide page 10](../../docs/guide/10-recipes-and-pitfalls.md) has more pitfalls and the recipes worth copying.

## Make pstack my own

- [`/automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/poteto-mode`.
- [`/reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

[Guide page 9](../../docs/guide/09-make-it-yours.md) covers each of these.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
